# Homotopy (type) theory

A doctoral course on homotopy theory and homotopy type theory given by
[Andrej Bauer](http://www.andrej.com) and [Jaka Smrekar](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/~smrekar/)
at the [Faculty of mathematics and Physics](http://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/), University of Ljubljana,
in the Spring of 2019.

In this course we first overview the basics of classical homotopy theory. Starting with
the notion of locally trivial bundles, we motivate the classical definitions of
fibrations, from which we proceed to identify the abstract strucure of Quillen model
categories. We consider chain complexes as an example of model categories, and build up
enough material to be able to understand the natural ambient for homotopy theory, namely
the simplicial sets.

In the second part we introduce homotopy type theory from the point of view of classical
homotopy theory, deliberately avoiding the connections between homotopy type theory and
computer science. The simplicial sets serve as the motivating model category from which we
extract the basic type-theoretic constructions. We then show how type theory can be used
to carry out homotopy-theoretic arguments abstractly and "synthetically". The fact that
any construction expressed in homotopy type theory is homotopy invariant is both a
blessing and a curse: a blessing because it never lets us step outside of the realm of
homotopy theory, and a curse because we it never lets us step outside of the realm of
homotopy theory.

## Course administration

We meet weekly on Tuesdays from 14:00 to 16:00 in lecture room 3.06 at the Mathematics
department.

There will be two take-home exams, one for each part of the course.
