# Homotopy type theory

Course overview.

## Homotopy theory

###  Background & bundles

#### Background

##### What does (a part of) math deal with?

##### Distinguishing between objects: relax, distinguish, stiffen

##### Homotopy theory as a natural domain of algebraic invariants

##### Homotopy theory as means of rephrasing a geometric problem

#### Bundles

##### Bundles are omnipresent

##### Vector bundle and its frame bundle

##### Bundles with structure group

##### Principal bundles and classification

##### Lifting properties

##### Homotopization of bundles

###  Fibrations of topological spaces, and their classification

###  Cofibrations & model structure

###  Loop spaces, suspensions and other gadgets

###  Chain complexes

###  Kan simplicial sets

## Homotopy type theory

### Type theory (motivated by simplicial sets): ∏, Σ

### Identity types as path objects (applications)

### Logic from geometry (propositions-as-types)

### Synthetic homotopy theory: circle, suspension

### Univalence axiom

### Applications of univalence: loop space, π₁(S¹) = Z
