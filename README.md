A doctoral course on homotopy theory and homotopy type theory given by
[Andrej Bauer](http://www.andrej.com) and [Jaka Smrekar](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/~smrekar/)
at the [Faculty of mathematics and Physics](http://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/), University of Ljubljana.

## Course overview

### Homotopy theory

####  Background & bundles

##### Background

* What does (a part of) math deal with?
* Distinguishing between objects: relax, distinguish, stiffen
* Homotopy theory as a natural domain of algebraic invariants
* Homotopy theory as means of rephrasing a geometric problem

#### Bundles

* Bundles are omnipresent
* Vector bundle and its frame bundle
* Bundles with structure group
* Principal bundles and classification
* Lifting properties
* Homotopization of bundles

####  Fibrations of topological spaces, and their classification

* Hurewicz fibrations; definition in terms of the right lifting property with respect to inclusions Z->Zx[0,1]
* Pullbacks and retracts of fibrations are fibrations
* Any map decomposes functorially as a composite of a SDR inclusion followed by fibration
* The concept of a lifting function
* The fibres of a fibration are homotopy equivalent
* Homotopy fibre
* Puppe sequence

####  Cofibrations & model structure

* Homotopy extension property, cofibration, Eckmann-Hilton duality
* Pushouts and retracts of cofibrations are cofibrations
* Any map decomposes functorially as a composite of a cofibration followed by a `trivial` fibration
* Quillen closed model category
* Model category on Top with homotopy equivalences, Hurewicz fibrations, and Hurewicz cofibrations

####  Loop spaces, suspensions and other gadgets

####  Chain complexes

####  Kan simplicial sets

### Homotopy type theory

#### Type theory (motivated by simplicial sets): `Π`, `Σ`

#### Identity types as path objects (applications)

#### Logic from geometry (propositions-as-types)

#### Synthetic homotopy theory: circle, suspension

#### Univalence axiom

#### Applications of univalence: loop space, `π₁(S¹) = Z`
